Start of week three. Realistic check: I’m not shipping a full product before leaving, but I can polish what exists.

- Re-read [[projects/250306_termflow_overview]] and [[projects/250310_termflow_architecture]] to prune scope.
- Focus this week: tighten the CLI flows, write a minimal README, and stop inventing new features.
- Also, find time to just enjoy the city before the flight back.
