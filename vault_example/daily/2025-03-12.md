Deep work attempt at a noisy café. Headphones helped, but the churn made it hard to keep flow. Still, got good progress on command structure.

- Reworked the flow between parsing flags and passing context to the model—captured in [[projects/250310_termflow_architecture]].
- Drafted UX thoughts in [[projects/250312_termflow_cli-ux]] about streaming output and error surfacing.
- TODO #todo: decide on default model selection; #decision: whether to cache embeddings locally or rely on API each time.
