First real work block here—3.5 hours in the afternoon with noise-canceling on. Sketched scope for the terminal AI helper and started [[250306_termflow_overview]] to keep ideas sane.

- Early command ideas: summarize staged changes, draft commit messages, answer “what changed in this folder?” questions.
- Thinking about streaming output so it feels responsive even when the model is slow.
- Need to decide how to store ephemeral context locally without making setup annoying.
