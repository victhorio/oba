Arrived in Lisbon after a long set of flights. Exhausted but the apartment is bright, a little humid, and right above a bakery.

- Walked the neighborhood just enough to find coffee and groceries.
- Jotted a sticky note about maybe hacking on a small terminal AI helper later this week, but brain is mush tonight.
- Intention for the next ~3 weeks: explore in the mornings, keep afternoons open for light planning and settling in.
