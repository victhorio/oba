Scattered day: errands, wandering, then a short burst of work before dinner. Mostly dumped unresolved questions into [[250321_termflow_open-questions]].

- Still not sure how opinionated the CLI should be vs staying generic.
- Might need a better fallback when the model is slow—maybe cached summaries?
