Half-day in Sintra (crowded, beautiful), half-day thinking about how to evaluate the helper. The train ride back was surprisingly productive.

- Drafted [[projects/250314_termflow_llm-evals]] with prompt ideas and simple “LLM-as-judge” loops.
- Keep referencing [[personal/250311_sintra_daytrip]] for the day-trip details so I don’t rewrite them here.
- Need to balance speed vs quality—maybe a quick/slow mode toggle for responses.
