Monday reset. Set a simple rule for the week: one focused work block per day, and no guilt about spending the rest exploring.

- Architecture questions for the helper are getting messy; started [[projects/250310_termflow_architecture]] to separate concerns.
- Might need a lightweight decision log so I stop circling the same choices.
- Plan: mornings out, afternoons for a 2–3 hour build session.
