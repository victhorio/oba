Café day with surprisingly good Wi‑Fi. Started sketching what a terminal-based AI helper could look like for day-to-day dev work.

- Need a place to log decisions and prompts; a dedicated project note would keep this from sprawling.
- Wondering about commands for summarizing diffs and answering repo questions without leaving the terminal.
- Not committing yet—just parking ideas until there’s a clearer shape.
