Weekend drift—wandered through Alfama and along the river. Sunny, crowded, and too easy to forget the laptop exists.

- Feeling torn between wanting to push the helper forward and just letting the trip be a trip.
- Reminded myself via [[projects/250306_termflow_overview]] not to over-engineer the architecture before writing more workflows.
- Small note: need to find a quieter café for focused days.
