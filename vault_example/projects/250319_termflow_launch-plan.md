#product #launch #todo

What “launch” means for the helper. This is intentionally minimal so it can ship before leaving town.

## Pre-trip tasks done
- Basic CLI skeleton with streaming responses (see [[projects/250310_termflow_architecture]]).
- Draft command set and flags captured in [[projects/250312_termflow_cli-ux]].
- Rough eval prompts in [[projects/250314_termflow_llm-evals]].

## Things to finish this week
- Write a concise README with install + quickstart.
- Add two example workflows (diff summary, failing test explainer).
- Harden error handling for missing git repos and missing API keys.

## Post-trip backlog
- Interactive session mode with short-term memory.
- Decide on OSS vs small paid tool; document maintenance expectations.
- Better caching strategy + optional analytics for usage patterns.
