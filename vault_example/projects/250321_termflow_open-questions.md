#decision #open-questions

Centralized list of unresolved items pulled from scattered notes ([[2025-03-14]], [[2025-03-21]]).

## Architecture
- How aggressive should context caching be before it risks staleness?
- Is multi-turn mode worth the complexity, or should the CLI stay stateless?

## UX
- Default to streaming always, or allow a non-stream mode for piping outputs?
- How opinionated should command names be vs exposing a generic “prompt” entrypoint?

## Product/ops
- Open source vs tiny paid release? What does maintenance look like as a solo project?
- Do we need lightweight telemetry to know which commands land, or is that overreach?
- What is the onboarding story for new repos—guided setup vs sensible defaults?
