## Structure
- Root folders only; no nested folders beyond these: `daily/`, `projects/`, `personal/`.
- Daily notes live in `daily/` and drive most linking; other notes stay in their folder.
- An atemporal capture note sits at `inbox.md` for unstructured future tasks.

## Naming conventions
- Daily: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2025-03-12.md`).
- Project/personal: `YYMMDD_name.md` (e.g., `250310_termflow_architecture.md`).
- This file is atemporal meta guidance; treat it as a reference, not content to summarize.

## Linking and tags
- Obsidian-style wiki-links connect notes, especially from dailies to project/personal pages.
- Tags are inline (`#work`, `#travel`, `#decision`, etc.) and informal; no strict taxonomy.

## Content orientation
- Dailies describe a 3-week Lisbon trip plus side-project work on a terminal AI helper.
- Project notes track the helper’s overview, architecture, CLI UX, eval ideas, launch plan, and open questions.
- Personal notes cover travel itinerary, a Sintra trip log, remote work rules, and end-of-trip reflections.

## Agent usage tips
- When asked for context, start from the relevant daily note, then follow links to project/personal notes.
- Respect naming: prefer existing `YYMMDD_*` pattern when suggesting new project/personal notes.
- Avoid inventing nested folders or new taxonomies; keep additions flat within existing folders.
- Triage loose items from `inbox.md` into the right folder when structure is requested.
