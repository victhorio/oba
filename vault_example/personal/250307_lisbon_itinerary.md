Rough itinerary for the first stretch in Lisbon. Linked from [[2025-03-03]] and updated as spots get checked off.

## Places to visit
- Alfama wander + miradouros (Miradouro da Graça, Santa Luzia).
- Day trip candidates: Sintra (already penciled), Cascais if time.
- LX Factory for a weekend browse.

## Coffee / work-friendly
- Hello, Kristof (small, calm in the morning).
- Fábrica Coffee Roasters (good Wi‑Fi, can get busy).
- Heim Café (maybe too crowded for work—scout first).

## Food notes
- Time Out Market for quick meals; treat as backup, not a destination.
- Pão from the bakery downstairs; pastel de nata quota = once per day max.
