Narrative from the Sintra day trip referenced in [[daily/2025-03-14]].

## What went well
- Early train avoided most of the crowds; bought return ticket right away.
- Pena Palace exterior is worth it; inside was fine but skippable.
- Took the forest path down instead of the shuttle—quiet and shaded.

## What was overrated
- The shuttle line was chaos; glad I skipped it.
- Tourist-trap pastries near the station; better to wait until Lisbon.

## Notes to future self
- Bring a sandwich and extra water; food options are limited once you start hiking.
- If going again, choose one palace + the Moorish Castle, skip the rest.
