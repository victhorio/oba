End-of-trip reflection linked from [[daily/2025-03-23]]. Quick dump before the flight.

## Trip takeaways
- Best days balanced a morning wander with an afternoon focus block.
- Lisbon felt both familiar and new; would come back in a cooler month.
- Sintra was worth it but once is enough; next time, maybe head south instead.

## Project status
- The helper is a functional prototype: streaming works, commands are coherent, and docs are draft-level.
- Architecture feels sane ([[projects/250310_termflow_architecture]]), but eval and launch plans need more reps ([[projects/250314_termflow_llm-evals]], [[projects/250319_termflow_launch-plan]]).
- Still undecided on open-sourcing; leaning toward a small OSS launch first to get feedback.

## If doing this again
- Book lodgings closer to quieter cafés.
- Schedule one no-laptop day per week.
- Start travel notes earlier so they don’t pile up at the end.
