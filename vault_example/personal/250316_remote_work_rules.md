Short rules for working on side projects while traveling. Informed by [[250306_termflow_overview]] and the guilt vs productivity cycles in [[2025-03-09]] and [[2025-03-10]].

## Rules
- One focused block per day is enough; anything extra is bonus.
- Protect mornings for exploring; work in the afternoon when energy dips anyway.
- Write down decisions immediately; circling the same debates is a time sink.
- Keep the tool usable at all times—no broken main branches.

## Guardrails
- No working after 8pm; go for a walk instead.
- If stuck for 30 minutes, log the blockage and switch tasks or stop.
- Treat travel notes as important as tech notes; both matter to memory.
