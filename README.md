If our Obsidian vault is our second brain, why not use it to power an agent?

The idea behind `oba` is to have a TUI-based agent that can interact with you and the Obsidian vault, and should be able to help with:

1. Retrieving information from the vault and help you remember things from it in a natural way
2. Help you clean up notes and refactor them
3. Help you create new notes based on conversations

For now it does nothing though, so let's see where this goes.
